# Paper Webui

Manage a [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) server through a webui

(Probably, maybe, possibly... works with a standard Minecraft server aswell)

## Todo / random thoughts

- [x] Live server logs
- [x] Sending "raw" server commands through webui
- [ ] Instance "Stopping" state
- [ ] Simple webui only setup using [PaperMC API](https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/) (also maybe using Mojangs standard releases) + eula accept form
- [ ] Initial and max memory management
- [x] Players online molecule (roles, OP level?)
- [ ] Multi-instance~
- [ ] Whitelist management
- [ ] Ports management
- [ ] Webui authentication
